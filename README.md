# Simongame
It’s a fun and challenging game that puts your memory and reflexes to the test. The game consists of four colored buttons that light up and play a sound in a specific sequence. Your goal is to repeat the sequence by pressing the buttons in the same order. The catch? With each round, the sequence gets longer and more complex, making it even more difficult to remember.
